<h1>A script to set up WAN/LAN/WLAN to get you started - Mikrotik Script RouterOS</h1>
NOTE - This script only works on ROS 4.6-5.x it does not work on ROS 6.x
In version 4.6, MikroTik deprecated some commands. The script has been edited to support the new command set and consequently won't work on any version prior to 4.6. The method of checking the version number appears to be broken in 5.0beta2 and so there is no longer any check before the script is run. If you run it on a version <4.6 or >=6, it'll just crash nastily instead.

The Explanation
I wanted a script which would set up a ROS box in a reasonably generic way, allowing it to be customised after all the samey-samey stuff had been done.

The script below allows the setting up of LAN, WAN (direct connect or PPPoE) and, optionally, WLAN. It is entirely driven by variables which are defined in the first part of the script.

A brief description of the functions configured:

Set password for admin user
Set up NTP client, including adding a script to ensure pool.ntp.org FQDNs are regularly resolved and updated
Set up NTP server on LAN/WLAN
Set up e-mail details (so the box can e-mail you)
Set up name servers
Set up PPPoE connection (optional)
Set up WiFi access point and bridge to LAN (optional)
Set up WAN and LAN addressing and default gateway
Set up DHCP server on LAN/WLAN (optional)
Configure NAT on LAN/WLAN (optional)
Set up basic firewall rules
Add and schedule script to ensure mail server FQDN is resolved regularly
Add and schedule script to ensure NTP servers FQDNs are resolved regularly
Add and schedule script to take system backup
Add and schedule script to run on boot to notify of reboot
Add and schedule script to monitor PPPoE connection and restart if we are allocated an address we're not expecting (useful for UK BT based ADSL circuits where BT decide to take over the connection every now and again) (optional)
I would appreciate feedback on this - if you have found it useful or if you have any suggestions for improving it, please don't hesitate to contact me - on the Mikrotik Forum, my username is 'nab'.

#################################################################
#
# The purpose of this script is to create a standard SOHO type
# configuration which can be built on by the user.
# It does not provide a complete solution, but should be enough
# to get you up and running.
#
#################################################################
# WARNING
# As this script stands, it will trash your existing configuration
# so don't run it on a router which has been customised or it won't
# be any more!
#
# DO NOT run this on a live production system.
#
# We accept absolutely no liability whatsoever. If you choose to run
# this script, anything bad that happens is entirely your problem.
# Of course, if you're happy, please let us know!!
#
# We recommend that your configuration be cleared with the command
# '/system routerboard reset-configuration'
# before this script is run.
#################################################################
#
# Make your changes here:
##########################
# Changes should be made to the text inside the speechmarks, for example....
# :local variablename "contents"
# should NOT be changed to
# :local myvariablename "contents"
# as this will crash everything!!
# Instead, you should put
# :local variablename "mycontents"
# or somesuch.
#
#
# Secure your RouterOS! Set the password you would like to use when logging on as 'admin'.
:local adminpassword "Password";
#
#
# Time servers (NTP).
# We use two NTP servers and these must be specified as FQDNs
# (Fully qualified domain names) - i.e. not IP addresss.
# Note that NTP we cannot assume that at the time configuration is run you will have an Internet
# connection and so we cannot set this up with the addresses you choose immediately (if we try to
# but RouterOS cannot resolve the host names, the script will crash). So we set up dummy IP addresses
# to start with and then configure a script to run regularly to ensure that
# the following addresses are used once the Internet connection is up. This sounds long and
# complicated, but it's actually a better way of doing things anyway - it means that if the IP
# addresses change for these hosts (as they will do if you use the pool.ntp.org addresses), your
# RouterOS will always be connected to a working server.
# The defaults are fine, but you may want to change one of the servers to point at your ISPs
# service if they run one.
:local ntpa "0.uk.pool.ntp.org";
:local ntpb "1.uk.pool.ntp.org";
# Now we define the temporary IP addresses to use pending resolution of the FQDNs above.
# You can probably leave them at the defaults, but this may mean that your ROS doesn't get
# the correct time for an hour or so. Note that once it has the correct time, it'll keep those
# IPs, so after a reboot, time syncing should be really quick.
:local ntptempa "81.187.81.101";
:local ntptempb "81.187.81.101";
#
#
# Set up mail defaults
# The 'emailserver' must be a FQDN and this setting works in the same way as the NTP servers above
# (i.e. we cannot assume that we can resolve the name right now)
:local emailserver "your.smtp.smarthost.com";
# Again, in the same way we did for NTP, above, we'll use the following IP address until we
# can resolve the FQDN specified above. You're OK leaving this as the default, but doing so
# may mean that e-mail doesn't work until the FQDN can be resolved.
:local emailservertempip "81.187.30.51";

:local emailfrom "RouterBoard <routeros.email@address>";
