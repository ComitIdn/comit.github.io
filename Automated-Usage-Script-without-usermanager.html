Summary
I wrote a usage tracking script based on the original Automated Billing Script
The way I run it is using a Mikrotik box setup to pass everything through transparently then I generated a Queue per IP address to keep track of the usage. On my test box (A PowerRouter 732) I currently have 3 class C blocks passing through with only 3% cpu (Multi CPU enabled).
This system is built for download-based billing only and will report the amount of downloads used by an IP address (or group if you setup a queue with multiple IP's) each month. (This could easily be switched around thou)
If you use the alternate version of the monthend script you can set the scheduler to run overseer every 1hour without having to worry about multiple reports coming through.
Additional, I've since written a smaller manual script for accounts so they can run this at any time and have the usage reports emailed through (see the manual usage report script)

Todo
- ability to backup to a file on the mikrotik so it will count both data in the queue currently + data usage saved in the file (in case you lose power to the device or have to restart it at any time) Rethought - now saves downloaded data onto the end of comment, so scripts can also be exported if required. Page now updated to save data in the newly added comment field (I've been using this since v3.24)
- modifying the monthend script further so that it can only be triggered on the last hour of the last day of the month. This means you could then run the usage script hourly to get more frequent updates. This has been done, see original and alternate versions of the Monthend Script See below the script for details on how it works.
- modify the usage and monthly report scripts to use kbyte variables instead of bytes (this shouldn't be any major issue thou, as the integer variables mikroik have allowed are 64bit, so a number can be as high as 9223372036854775807.
- allow sending to a client email address AND local support crew. Done: now you can specify a default email address in the usagereport (for sending to your support/accounts people) and the address in the queue becomes the client address to email, if you leave it blank eg: Client!50#!00#0000 instead of Client!50#client@example.com!00#0000 it will just skip sending the report email to the client but still send one to the support/accounts email address

Current known bugs
Monthend script will not complete (and won't generate end of month reports) if you have starttime set to 00:00:00 for the hourly scheduler. Fix: Set startime to 00:30:00 or you can also run the end of month report script manually if you had missed

The Scheduler
Hourly
If you wish to poll hourly ensure that firstly you are using the new short version of the monthend script and also ensure that your start time isn't 00:00:00 (setting it to 30m is ok like below) This ensures that the monthend time (being before >1:00am on the 1st of each month) is correctly matched and generates reports at the end of the month.

<code>/system scheduler
add comment="" disabled=no interval=1h name=Overseer on-event="/system script run overseer" start-date=jan/01/1970 start-time=00:30:00
The Scripts
Script: overseer
Like the automated billing, this also has a calling script "overseer"

/code>:global found

/system script run monthend

:if ([$found] = "true") do={/system script run monthlyreport; :log info "--Completed Monthly Report--"} else={ /system script run usagereport; :log info "--Completed Usage Report--"}
Script: monthend
At a set rollover date you want the system to run the monthend script to do the final site tally and reset all counters. By default this is set to run at the begining of each month (00 hour, 1st day) you can however change this to run on any day.

:local date
:local time
:local day
:local month
:local year
:local hour
:global found ""
 
:set date [/system clock get date]
:set time [/system clock get time]
:set day [:pick $date 4 6]
:set hour [:pick $time 0 2]

:if ([$day] = "01" ) do={ :if ([$hour] = "00" ) do={:set found "true" } else={ :set found "false" } } else={ :set found "false" }
Script: usagereport
The main usage report, takes the name of each queue and looks firstly for a hint that any data is contained in this. I have used ! to seperate the initial data block so If it finds a ! it will treat this name as data.

The data is then broken up from a name like this: Any Site name!50#info@yourcompany.com!00#0000 this then gives us $sitename (descriptive name) $gigs (gigabyte download limit) $email (address to email report to) $lastwarning (previous usage warning level) $bytesdownsaved (last total usage recording)

In previous versions of the script I had the values stored in the name, but now since it's available the comment is a much better place to store this data. This also means you can give users static URL's to access their own bandwidth graphs/queues.

#Script based on Automated billing script at http://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/AutomatedBilling
#Details:
#This script checks all current simple queues and using values stored in the queue comment will allow you keep track of usage by each site
#The details stored in the queue are broken down and used to determine when a user should be sent a usage warning at 50 75 90 and 100%
#You can create/modify a new entry as long as you follow this format
#1) If you just want to name an entry you may do so like "XYZ Router" in the queue name
#2) If you want to determine a data limit, enter it like "sitename!gigabytelimit#emailaddress!00#0000" into the comment.
#3) If you just want to enter a comment on its own, you can do this so long as you don't have an "!" in the field
#Breaking it down: sitename is a descriptive name, gigabyte limit is the monthy limit, email address is the address you want notified 
#00 is the last percentage warning level for this user, 0000 is the default value for a new data store

Final Notes
For those new to scripts, you can copy and paste these into winbox, but make sure that you at least remove the starting spacing from the comment lines (ones with #) if you don't they aren't treated as comments and will cause the script to error.

Quick trick to generate queues

#change the target address range to match what you want to generate.
:local x
:for x from 2 to 254 do={/queue simple add target-address="10.2.100.$x" queue="default/default"}
would generate queues for 10.0.0.2-10.0.0.254 for you.

note: the queue=default is important, as of v3.12 default-small queues with no child queues will be treated as if there was no queue at all (aka: unmonitored)</code>
