<h1>Mikrotik Terminal Command Line and Keyboard Command - Mikrotik Script</h1>
Command line or Terminal in ROS Mikrotik will actually be easier to understand if we are Linux users, because basically Mikrotik is Linux Base which is compiled for special purpose Router networks.

In monitoring the network, usually reliable administrators use the terminal more than the Winbox GUI or Webfig , perhaps in terms of security and speed.
